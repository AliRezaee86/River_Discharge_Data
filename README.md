# River_Discharge_Data
River discharge and related historical data from the Global Flood Awareness System
# This dataset provides gridded modelled daily hydrological time series forced with meteorological reanalysis data. The data set is a product of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) and offers a consistent representation of key hydrological variables across the global domain including:

* River discharge
* Soil wetness index (root zone)
* Snow water equivalent
* Runoff water equivalent (surface plus subsurface)

Also provided are two ancillary files for interpretation, one containing upstream area data and the other containing elevation data (see the table of related variables and the associated link in the documentation).
